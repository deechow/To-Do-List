# To Do List
 Create a To-Do Checklist

Let's build a simple to do app and put it up on github to help build out our portfolios.

Feel free to customize this app as you wish. (Try to use a framework to speed up development). The only requirements are:
- There is an input field for users to type in what they want to do
- There is a button to capture this input, and display the to dos
- Users can check off items to complete it (Let's just cross it out or change the UI to say that it has been completed)
